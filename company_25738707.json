Last chance to register for the phonics workshop. \n\nIn my upcoming workshop, I will introduce awareness of the importance of teaching phonics in the early years and primary education through storytelling and multi-sensory learning using the phonics shed scheme Synthetic systematic phonics programme (SSP). Phonics Shed is a multi-sensory and narrative-driven phonics programme validated and approved scheme by the Uk Department of Education. \n\nIt's my pleasure to announce I will be conducting a workshop on phonics with Early Childhood Development Forum. This workshop is for head teachers, leaders, teachers, teaching assistants and parents. Everyone will receive a certificate upon completion of the course. Also, you will get some free takeaways for all participants from our phonics shed team in the Uk. \n\nFor more information on the course, please DM or email me at fatima@edshed.com, and I will provide all the information you need! \n\nPhonics#teachers #team #development #email #education#Phonics Shed",

Last chance to register for the phonics workshop. \n\nIn my upcoming workshop, I will introduce awareness of the importance of teaching phonics in the early years and primary education through storytelling and multi-sensory learning using the phonics shed scheme Synthetic systematic phonics programme (SSP). Phonics Shed is a multi-sensory and narrative-driven phonics programme validated and approved scheme by the Uk Department of Education. \n\nIt's my pleasure to announce I will be conducting a workshop on phonics with Early Childhood Development Forum. This workshop is for head teachers, leaders, teachers, teaching assistants and parents. Everyone will receive a certificate upon completion of the course. Also, you will get some free takeaways for all participants from our phonics shed team in the Uk. \n\nFor more information on the course, please DM or email me at fatima@edshed.com, and I will provide all the information you need! \n\nPhonics#teachers #team #development #email #education#Phonics Shed",

      "description": "Does your Systematic Synthetic Phonics scheme meet the National Curriculum statutory requirements for KS1? Does it prepare your children for the more complex code they will encounter in their reading and writing in Year 3 and beyond?\n\nThe simple answer is that almost all Government Validated Phonics Schemes do not adequately cover the National Curriculum objectives.\n\nWe have found that objectives like those listed below are often omitted from phonics schemes. \n\n-tch \u2013 This sound is usually spelled as \u2018tch\u2019 if it comes straight after a single vowel letter. \nThe /v/ sound at the end of words. \nAdding -s and -es to words.\nAdding the endings -ing, -ed and -er to verbs where no change is needed to the root word. \nThe prefix un-.\n\nThese objectives need to be covered in order to meet National Curriculum requirements. Due to this, we advise that a spelling programme be used alongside your phonics programme.\n\nAnother reason for teaching spelling alongside phonics is that it allows children to draw upon a range of skills to spell words effectively. \n\nAll National Curriculum Objectives are explicitly taught through the Spelling Shed programme. \n\nWe suggest that schools begin using Spelling Shed alongside your chosen phonics scheme in years 1 and 2.  \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/enTU_bRn",
