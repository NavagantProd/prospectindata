As a mathematician in the Launch Vehicles Division, she developed coding for alternative energy experiments, paving the way for solar and wind technologies. Despite facing discrimination\u2014such as being denied tuition reimbursement that her male colleagues received\u2014Easley remained focused, saying: \"I'm out here to do a job, and I knew I had the ability to do it.\"\n\nFast forward to today, Daniela Rus is pushing the boundaries of robotics as the first female director of MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab. From robots that fly and swim to self-assembling machines, her work sounds like science fiction\u2014but it\u2019s shaping the future of technology.\n\nAs we near the end of Women's History Month, let\u2019s celebrate the fearless women who have transformed STEM and continue to inspire innovation! \ud83d\udca1 \n\n#WomenInSTEM #SpaceScience #FutureOfTech #WHM",
