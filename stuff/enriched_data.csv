ClassDojo for Districts is designed for pre-K through high school, offering seamless single sign-on, automatic rostering, full message histories, 24/7 support, and industry-leading privacy and security. It’s fully compliant with COPPA, FERPA, and the Student Privacy Pledge—all in a fast, easy-to-use app that millions already love. No learning curve. No extra complexity. It just works. And the best part? ClassDojo for Districts is free for partner districts. In an era where efficiency matters, we help districts avoid wasting taxpayer dollars on overpriced, underused technology. Instead, we save them money—so they can invest in what truly matters: teaching and learning.

We believe that a thriving school can change the world. It is our passion to give teachers the tools they need to keep kids engaged in the classroom and safe at school every day so that every student – no matter their learning style, background or ability – has the opportunity to learn, thrive and impact their community. Since the days of pioneering the first poster printer for schools we are driven by one question: “What do teachers need?”. We see teachers spend a ton of time working to differentiate curriculum, make RTI successful in each classroom and help students take the lead in their own learning. The VariQuest Visual & Kinesthetic Learning Tools streamline those efforts, create efficiencies and help teachers engage every learner, every day. We see library media specialists and administrators striving to create a safer, more efficient campus environment with student ID badges, but barely surviving the chaos of issuing cards at registration. We partnered with Irving ISD to bring the first web-based ID system for schools to the market. To date, CARDSonline is the easiest and most robust ID software for schools. It simplifies your ID process and gives you access to the information you need, when you need it most. Our line of Photo ID Printers was built to withstand casino traffic. They will easily tackle the workload of printing ID badges for your student population year after year. The driving force behind Precision Business Machines is and always will be our amazing customers. Your time is important, so when you need us, we’re here. A real person will always answer the phone and our local techs are always on alert, ready to help. When you invest in one of our products, you become part of the family. Our team provides full on-site delivery, installation and training. We see you through every step of the way+.",,Education,Privately Held,,11-50 employees,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018-01-16,,,,,

Your bio should be a glimpse in to who you are. If your bio reads like a resume you're already missing out on credibility and connection. Imagine if potential clients or partners could read your connection story and know that you care, that you were born to do this, that without a doubt you are the best fit. Like they actually know you. That’s why I create bio STORIES. No one does business with a business. PEOPLE do BUSINESS with PEOPLE - Those whose personalities, passions and purposes align with their own. And there’s no better way to communicate yours than with an expertly crafted story that digs deep into who you are, why you do what you do and what makes you the only viable option for your prospects. I draw on 30 years of experience as a professional writer and TV/film producer to create engaging, effective stories for executives, high-level entrepreneurs and established entertainers. My print work has appeared in top national publications including People, Chicago Sun-Times and Street & Smith's Sports Business Journal and I’ve produced projects ranging from minute-long video packages for TV news stations and the NFL’s Jacksonville Jaguars to feature-length documentary and narrative films. My coverage runs the gamut from human interest to crime, music to medicine, small business trends to major breaking news. But my passion is in interviewing, writing and producing stories about people – particularly those who are PASSIONATE about their own endeavors, know their WHYs and have the BOLDNESS to take risks in business and in life to be successful. Via Maven Maker, a brand of Stuart Media LLC, I offer written biographical stories including first-person LinkedIn summaries; 1- to 2-page magazine-style bios for use on websites and in media kits; and biographical videos shot in-studio or on-location.
