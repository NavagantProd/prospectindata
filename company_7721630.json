However, the SoR movement presents two negative impacts on long-term literacy education\u2014a commitment to the \u201cSimple View\u201d of Reading (SVR) and mandates for phonics-first instruction for all beginning readers. In this webinar, Paul Thomas, Ed.D. (Professor of Education, Furman University, and author of How to End the Reading War and Serve the Literacy Needs of All Students), places the SoR movement within the context of the robust but complex current state of reading science.

However, the SoR movement presents two negative impacts on long-term literacy education\u2014a commitment to the \u201cSimple View\u201d of Reading (SVR) and mandates for phonics-first instruction for all beginning readers. In this webinar, Paul Thomas, Ed.D. (Professor of Education, Furman University, and author of How to End the Reading War and Serve the Literacy Needs of All Students), places the SoR movement within the context of the robust but complex current state of reading science.

This month is dedicated to recognizing and honoring the contributions of Americans with ancestors from a country that speaks Spanish as the primary language: Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America, and Spain. While the official designation for the people being celebrated this month is Hispanic, when it comes to describing identity, many different terms are used. For example, Latino/a or Latinx (a gender-neutral alternative) or one\u2019s family\u2019s Country of Origin, such as Mexican or Cuban American, are acceptable, depending on the individual\u2019s preference. I myself am happy to be referred to as Hispanic, Latina, Chicana, or Mexican American. Checking in with others and seeing how they prefer to be identified is always a great practice! \n\nJoin PVB in celebrating those who have contributed so much!",

While the official designation for the people being celebrated this month is Hispanic, when it comes to describing identity, many different terms are used. For example, Latino/a or Latinx (a gender-neutral alternative) or one\u2019s family\u2019s Country of Origin, such as Mexican or Cuban American, are acceptable, depending on the individual\u2019s preference. I myself am happy to be referred to as Hispanic, Latina, Chicana, or Mexican American. Checking in with others and seeing how they prefer to be identified is always a great practice! \n\nJoin PVB in celebrating those who have contributed so much!",

      "description": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0fIn this thoughtful interview with Dr. Sam Bommarito, Susan Vincent talks about research that suggests the benefit of using multiple types of text in literacy instruction. Susan highlights several highly respected sources as she shares her perspective on text selection, including both decodables and leveled texts. \n\n\ud83d\udcdaAt Pioneer Valley Books we have always believed that children deserve to read high-quality books during each chapter of their literacy journey. We have been committed to this mission since day one. \n\n\ud83c\udf4f\ud83c\udf4eWe encourage all practicing teachers to consider Susan\u2019s suggested criteria for book selection. The titles that we choose we put in front of children gives them a message about reading and about what literacy is. That is a big responsibility and we are honored that so many educators trust us to be their partner in literacy. \n\nFollow the link below to read the blog and watch the full interview. \ud83d\udd17 >>>> https://bit.ly/4aveXCt \n\n#LiteracyInstruction #TeacherResources #LiteracyPartners",

Here at Pioneer Valley Books, we are grateful for Dr. Aukerman\u2019s thoughtful analysis of the current conversations addressing literacy education practices. We encourage you to invest 90 minutes to soak up the knowledge presented.\n\nJoin the conversation here! >>>>>",

Furthermore, students in kindergarten, grade 1, and grade 2 using Stepping Together and Phonics Launch all demonstrated significantly higher scores in the i-Ready over students that did not use the programs.\n\nRead the full report: https://lnkd.in/e3Mp2Uz2",

In Tandem and Phonics Launch are now approved by the Ohio Department of Education as evidence-based reading intervention programs, making it easier to bring these powerful resources into your classrooms. \ud83c\udf89\n\nIn Tandem strengthens phonics, fluency, and comprehension through a 5-day lesson that pairs a decodable book with a fiction or nonfiction text. Phonics Launch builds phonemic awareness, phonics, and fluency, offering flexible lessons for small-group instruction.\n\nPlus, both programs include pre-alphabetic lessons that provide essential support for early learners, building alphabet knowledge, phonological awareness, and concepts of print.\n\nWe're looking forward to supporting educators in Ohio with our effective interventions!",

In Tandem and Phonics Launch are now approved by the Ohio Department of Education as evidence-based reading intervention programs, making it easier to bring these powerful resources into your classrooms. \ud83c\udf89\n\nIn Tandem strengthens phonics, fluency, and comprehension through a 5-day lesson that pairs a decodable book with a fiction or nonfiction text. Phonics Launch builds phonemic awareness, phonics, and fluency, offering flexible lessons for small-group instruction.\n\nPlus, both programs include pre-alphabetic lessons that provide essential support for early learners, building alphabet knowledge, phonological awareness, and concepts of print.\n\nWe're looking forward to supporting educators in Ohio with our effective interventions!",
