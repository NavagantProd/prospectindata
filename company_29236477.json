The energy and enthusiasm from the teachers were truly inspiring\u2014it reminded us why we do what we do!\nDuring the session, Karan Gupta (Co-Founder) and Karn Ragade (Director of Curriculum) demonstrated how AssessPrep streamlines the assessment cycle\u2014from creation to analysis\u2014helping teachers save valuable time & increase their productivity.\u00a0\nWe were thrilled to introduce our new AssessPrep AI features and our IB DP question bank, and it was incredible to see the excitement from the teachers. The thoughtful feedback and insightful discussions with the teachers will undoubtedly help shape the future of AssessPrep.\nA special thank you to Mr. Thavamani (Head of Academics), Mrs. Deepthi C.K (DP Coordinator), and Ms. Kalyani G(MYP Coordinator) for their warm hospitality and invaluable insights.\nThank you, Sharanya Narayani International School, for being a beacon of educational excellence and for partnering with us on this journey!
