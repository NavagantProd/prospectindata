The service allows you to make full use of outstaffing to quickly launch IT projects by attracting self-organized teams.\nYou can hire ready-made teams with a proven track record capable of taking on any serious project on short notice.\nIn the coming weeks, we'll deploy a directory of teams.\n\n\ud83d\udfe3Teams Interface\nThanks to the newly-added Teams interface, Project Managers can build their own teams to execute full-cycle projects, as well as offer full-time or part-time employment and cooperate with numerous experts.\nThis section helps PMs put together custom teams consisting of specialists from and outside of Linki whom they can invite at any moment.\nAlternatively, you can join Linki with your existing team and expand it by recruiting the experts available on the platform, choosing those with the optimal skillset and productivity level.\n\n\u2753How PMs Can Create Teams\nA PM can create a new team\u2019s profile by adding a description, specifying its areas of expertise, and attaching a portfolio. After joining the team, the PM can plan the workload and assign team members to any project immediately.\n\n\ud83d\udfe3PMs can add team members by selecting them from their list of favorite experts or via a referral link. In order to join the team, the Expert needs to accept an offer from the PM.\n\n\ud83d\udfe3By default, Experts can join any number of teams.\nYet, PMs can mark a certain Expert as their exclusive employee. This way, the Expert will lose the ability to work with other PMs or accept any external job offers. Such a format fits established studios and agencies that have their own employees and wish to get an extra stream of orders.",

The service allows you to make full use of outstaffing to quickly launch IT projects by attracting self-organized teams.\nYou can hire ready-made teams with a proven track record capable of taking on any serious project on short notice.\nIn the coming weeks, we'll deploy a directory of teams.\n\n\ud83d\udfe3Teams Interface\nThanks to the newly-added Teams interface, Project Managers can build their own teams to execute full-cycle projects, as well as offer full-time or part-time employment and cooperate with numerous experts.\nThis section helps PMs put together custom teams consisting of specialists from and outside of Linki whom they can invite at any moment.\nAlternatively, you can join Linki with your existing team and expand it by recruiting the experts available on the platform, choosing those with the optimal skillset and productivity level.\n\n\u2753How PMs Can Create Teams\nA PM can create a new team\u2019s profile by adding a description, specifying its areas of expertise, and attaching a portfolio. After joining the team, the PM can plan the workload and assign team members to any project immediately.\n\n\ud83d\udfe3PMs can add team members by selecting them from their list of favorite experts or via a referral link. In order to join the team, the Expert needs to accept an offer from the PM.\n\n\ud83d\udfe3By default, Experts can join any number of teams.\nYet, PMs can mark a certain Expert as their exclusive employee. This way, the Expert will lose the ability to work with other PMs or accept any external job offers. Such a format fits established studios and agencies that have their own employees and wish to get an extra stream of orders.",

The service allows you to make full use of outstaffing to quickly launch IT projects by attracting self-organized teams.\nYou can hire ready-made teams with a proven track record capable of taking on any serious project on short notice.\nIn the coming weeks, we'll deploy a directory of teams.\n\n\ud83d\udfe3Teams Interface\nThanks to the newly-added Teams interface, Project Managers can build their own teams to execute full-cycle projects, as well as offer full-time or part-time employment and cooperate with numerous experts.\nThis section helps PMs put together custom teams consisting of specialists from and outside of Linki whom they can invite at any moment.\nAlternatively, you can join Linki with your existing team and expand it by recruiting the experts available on the platform, choosing those with the optimal skillset and productivity level.\n\n\u2753How PMs Can Create Teams\nA PM can create a new team\u2019s profile by adding a description, specifying its areas of expertise, and attaching a portfolio. After joining the team, the PM can plan the workload and assign team members to any project immediately.\n\n\ud83d\udfe3PMs can add team members by selecting them from their list of favorite experts or via a referral link. In order to join the team, the Expert needs to accept an offer from the PM.\n\n\ud83d\udfe3By default, Experts can join any number of teams.\nYet, PMs can mark a certain Expert as their exclusive employee. This way, the Expert will lose the ability to work with other PMs or accept any external job offers. Such a format fits established studios and agencies that have their own employees and wish to get an extra stream of orders.",

      "description": "How to Use Cryptocurrency Payments?\n\nLet\u2019s now explore how you can begin using cryptocurrencies and make full use of them.\n\nHow to Buy Crypto with Fiat\nYou can purchase your Bitcoin or other digital assets via special centralized crypto exchanges. There are a plethora of them on the market these days. Still, the most reputable ones include Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, etc.\nYou also can use P2P platforms that let you exchange your fiat money for crypto directly with other people. Still, such websites cannot protect you from scams.\n\nHow to Create a Wallet on an Exchange\nWhen you register your account on a centralized exchange, you immediately get assigned crypto wallet addresses for different types of cryptocurrencies. These addresses are similar to bank account numbers. You will have a different wallet address for each coin.\nYou can also generate your own wallet address by installing a non-custodial wallet such as Exodus.\n\nHow to Pay with Crypto\nIn order to pay someone with crypto, you only need to ask them for their crypto address and their preferred blockchain network. You will need to use this address and network to send the person a sum in crypto. If you utilize a centralized exchange such as Binance, you can conduct a payment by simply typing in the payout address, choosing the needed network, and specifying how much money you wish to send.\n\nHow to Add Crypto Payments to Legal Contracts\nYou can easily make payments in crypto official and legal, by adding information about them to your documentation. In the contract, you just need to specify the wallet address, the network, and the cryptocurrency used for payment.\n\n#blockchain #cryptocurrency #cryptopayments  #bitcoin #stablecoins #usdt",

      "description": "Why You Need to Switch to Crypto Payments?\n\nThe idea that Bitcoin has revolutionized the sphere of international finance is far from being an exaggeration. Nowadays, it is pretty clear to everyone that cryptocurrencies are here to stay, which is evidenced by the massive size of their market. If you are still reluctant to give digital assets a shot, chances are you will not have any other option than moving on to crypto payments in the next five years due to the expected rate of crypto adoption. Why not be ahead of the curve and start reaping all the benefits of the decentralized economy now?\n\nCash is no longer king\nToday, we are witnessing a rapid death of cash as a go-to form of payment. Thanks to the efforts of the likes of Visa, debit and credit cards have become the preferred way for people to do shopping or conduct money transfers. Yet, despite the absolute domination of payment networks, cryptocurrencies are gradually becoming worthy contenders for them. While cards still imply the use of cash in some way or another (you may need to top up your card using the ATM), cryptocurrencies do not have a physical form in the first place. Thus, Bitcoin and its successors constitute the next step in digital finance\n\nStablecoins\nOut of all types of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins constitute the most convenient for the average consumer. Stablecoins are digital currencies which are pegged to the price of mainstream fiat currencies. For instance, one of the most popular stablecoins Tether (USDT) is pegged to the U.S. Dollar. This means that 1 Tether always equals 1 dollar. Stablecoins address the key issue slowing down the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies, namely, price fluctuations. Stablecoins do not experience any changes in their price, thus letting users utilize them as an alternative to fiat currencies while benefiting from the inherent qualities of digital assets\n\nCrypto Payment Advantages\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \t\nThe speed of transactions is among the primary features of cryptocurrencies. It does not take more than a couple of minutes for a crypto transaction to get processed. Of course, each crypto has its own speed of transactions, so you can find both those taking half an hour or five seconds to reach the recipient. For the most part, it is much faster than the speed of an average bank transfer.\nCrypto transactions are borderless. Basically, cryptocurrencies are not subject to any geographic restrictions. So, users worldwide can receive and send digital assets as long as they have access to the internet\nCryptocurrencies are anonymous. They do not ask users to share any personal information because their underlying technology of blockchain is decentralized. Thus, when you pay with crypto, you always remain private\nCryptocurrency transactions are cheap, as in most cases, one will only need to pay a small fee. Compared to banks that charge clients substantial sums of money in the form of fees, cryptocurrency transactions usually cost less than a penny",

      "description": "How to Use Cryptocurrency Payments?\n\nLet\u2019s now explore how you can begin using cryptocurrencies and make full use of them.\n\nHow to Buy Crypto with Fiat\nYou can purchase your Bitcoin or other digital assets via special centralized crypto exchanges. There are a plethora of them on the market these days. Still, the most reputable ones include Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, etc.\nYou also can use P2P platforms that let you exchange your fiat money for crypto directly with other people. Still, such websites cannot protect you from scams.\n\nHow to Create a Wallet on an Exchange\nWhen you register your account on a centralized exchange, you immediately get assigned crypto wallet addresses for different types of cryptocurrencies. These addresses are similar to bank account numbers. You will have a different wallet address for each coin.\nYou can also generate your own wallet address by installing a non-custodial wallet such as Exodus.\n\nHow to Pay with Crypto\nIn order to pay someone with crypto, you only need to ask them for their crypto address and their preferred blockchain network. You will need to use this address and network to send the person a sum in crypto. If you utilize a centralized exchange such as Binance, you can conduct a payment by simply typing in the payout address, choosing the needed network, and specifying how much money you wish to send.\n\nHow to Add Crypto Payments to Legal Contracts\nYou can easily make payments in crypto official and legal, by adding information about them to your documentation. In the contract, you just need to specify the wallet address, the network, and the cryptocurrency used for payment.\n\n#blockchain #cryptocurrency #cryptopayments  #bitcoin #stablecoins #usdt",

      "description": "Why You Need to Switch to Crypto Payments?\n\nThe idea that Bitcoin has revolutionized the sphere of international finance is far from being an exaggeration. Nowadays, it is pretty clear to everyone that cryptocurrencies are here to stay, which is evidenced by the massive size of their market. If you are still reluctant to give digital assets a shot, chances are you will not have any other option than moving on to crypto payments in the next five years due to the expected rate of crypto adoption. Why not be ahead of the curve and start reaping all the benefits of the decentralized economy now?\n\nCash is no longer king\nToday, we are witnessing a rapid death of cash as a go-to form of payment. Thanks to the efforts of the likes of Visa, debit and credit cards have become the preferred way for people to do shopping or conduct money transfers. Yet, despite the absolute domination of payment networks, cryptocurrencies are gradually becoming worthy contenders for them. While cards still imply the use of cash in some way or another (you may need to top up your card using the ATM), cryptocurrencies do not have a physical form in the first place. Thus, Bitcoin and its successors constitute the next step in digital finance\n\nStablecoins\nOut of all types of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins constitute the most convenient for the average consumer. Stablecoins are digital currencies which are pegged to the price of mainstream fiat currencies. For instance, one of the most popular stablecoins Tether (USDT) is pegged to the U.S. Dollar. This means that 1 Tether always equals 1 dollar. Stablecoins address the key issue slowing down the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies, namely, price fluctuations. Stablecoins do not experience any changes in their price, thus letting users utilize them as an alternative to fiat currencies while benefiting from the inherent qualities of digital assets\n\nCrypto Payment Advantages\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \t\nThe speed of transactions is among the primary features of cryptocurrencies. It does not take more than a couple of minutes for a crypto transaction to get processed. Of course, each crypto has its own speed of transactions, so you can find both those taking half an hour or five seconds to reach the recipient. For the most part, it is much faster than the speed of an average bank transfer.\nCrypto transactions are borderless. Basically, cryptocurrencies are not subject to any geographic restrictions. So, users worldwide can receive and send digital assets as long as they have access to the internet\nCryptocurrencies are anonymous. They do not ask users to share any personal information because their underlying technology of blockchain is decentralized. Thus, when you pay with crypto, you always remain private\nCryptocurrency transactions are cheap, as in most cases, one will only need to pay a small fee. Compared to banks that charge clients substantial sums of money in the form of fees, cryptocurrency transactions usually cost less than a penny",

You will have a different wallet address for each coin.\nYou can also generate your own wallet address by installing a non-custodial wallet such as Exodus.\n\nHow to Pay with Crypto\nIn order to pay someone with crypto, you only need to ask them for their crypto address and their preferred blockchain network. You will need to use this address and network to send the person a sum in crypto. If you utilize a centralized exchange such as Binance, you can conduct a payment by simply typing in the payout address, choosing the needed network, and specifying how much money you wish to send.\n\nHow to Add Crypto Payments to Legal Contracts\nYou can easily make payments in crypto official and legal, by adding information about them to your documentation. In the contract, you just need to specify the wallet address, the network, and the cryptocurrency used for payment.\n\n#blockchain #cryptocurrency #cryptopayments  #bitcoin #stablecoins #usdt",

      "description": "Why You Need to Switch to Crypto Payments?\n\nThe idea that Bitcoin has revolutionized the sphere of international finance is far from being an exaggeration. Nowadays, it is pretty clear to everyone that cryptocurrencies are here to stay, which is evidenced by the massive size of their market. If you are still reluctant to give digital assets a shot, chances are you will not have any other option than moving on to crypto payments in the next five years due to the expected rate of crypto adoption. Why not be ahead of the curve and start reaping all the benefits of the decentralized economy now?\n\nCash is no longer king\nToday, we are witnessing a rapid death of cash as a go-to form of payment. Thanks to the efforts of the likes of Visa, debit and credit cards have become the preferred way for people to do shopping or conduct money transfers. Yet, despite the absolute domination of payment networks, cryptocurrencies are gradually becoming worthy contenders for them. While cards still imply the use of cash in some way or another (you may need to top up your card using the ATM), cryptocurrencies do not have a physical form in the first place. Thus, Bitcoin and its successors constitute the next step in digital finance\n\nStablecoins\nOut of all types of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins constitute the most convenient for the average consumer. Stablecoins are digital currencies which are pegged to the price of mainstream fiat currencies. For instance, one of the most popular stablecoins Tether (USDT) is pegged to the U.S. Dollar. This means that 1 Tether always equals 1 dollar. Stablecoins address the key issue slowing down the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies, namely, price fluctuations. Stablecoins do not experience any changes in their price, thus letting users utilize them as an alternative to fiat currencies while benefiting from the inherent qualities of digital assets\n\nCrypto Payment Advantages\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \t\nThe speed of transactions is among the primary features of cryptocurrencies. It does not take more than a couple of minutes for a crypto transaction to get processed. Of course, each crypto has its own speed of transactions, so you can find both those taking half an hour or five seconds to reach the recipient. For the most part, it is much faster than the speed of an average bank transfer.\nCrypto transactions are borderless. Basically, cryptocurrencies are not subject to any geographic restrictions. So, users worldwide can receive and send digital assets as long as they have access to the internet\nCryptocurrencies are anonymous. They do not ask users to share any personal information because their underlying technology of blockchain is decentralized. Thus, when you pay with crypto, you always remain private\nCryptocurrency transactions are cheap, as in most cases, one will only need to pay a small fee. Compared to banks that charge clients substantial sums of money in the form of fees, cryptocurrency transactions usually cost less than a penny",

The service allows you to make full use of outstaffing to quickly launch IT projects by attracting self-organized teams.\nYou can hire ready-made teams with a proven track record capable of taking on any serious project on short notice.\nIn the coming weeks, we'll deploy a directory of teams.\n\n\ud83d\udfe3Teams Interface\nThanks to the newly-added Teams interface, Project Managers can build their own teams to execute full-cycle projects, as well as offer full-time or part-time employment and cooperate with numerous experts.\nThis section helps PMs put together custom teams consisting of specialists from and outside of Linki whom they can invite at any moment.\nAlternatively, you can join Linki with your existing team and expand it by recruiting the experts available on the platform, choosing those with the optimal skillset and productivity level.\n\n\u2753How PMs Can Create Teams\nA PM can create a new team\u2019s profile by adding a description, specifying its areas of expertise, and attaching a portfolio. After joining the team, the PM can plan the workload and assign team members to any project immediately.\n\n\ud83d\udfe3PMs can add team members by selecting them from their list of favorite experts or via a referral link. In order to join the team, the Expert needs to accept an offer from the PM.\n\n\ud83d\udfe3By default, Experts can join any number of teams.\nYet, PMs can mark a certain Expert as their exclusive employee. This way, the Expert will lose the ability to work with other PMs or accept any external job offers. Such a format fits established studios and agencies that have their own employees and wish to get an extra stream of orders.",

Still, the most reputable ones include Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, etc.\nYou also can use P2P platforms that let you exchange your fiat money for crypto directly with other people.

You will need to use this address and network to send the person a sum in crypto. If you utilize a centralized exchange such as Binance, you can conduct a payment by simply typing in the payout address, choosing the needed network, and specifying how much money you wish to send.\n\nHow to Add Crypto Payments to Legal Contracts\nYou can easily make payments in crypto official and legal, by adding information about them to your documentation. In the contract, you just need to specify the wallet address, the network, and the cryptocurrency used for payment.\n\n#blockchain #cryptocurrency #cryptopayments  #bitcoin #stablecoins #usdt",

      "description": "Why You Need to Switch to Crypto Payments?\n\nThe idea that Bitcoin has revolutionized the sphere of international finance is far from being an exaggeration. Nowadays, it is pretty clear to everyone that cryptocurrencies are here to stay, which is evidenced by the massive size of their market. If you are still reluctant to give digital assets a shot, chances are you will not have any other option than moving on to crypto payments in the next five years due to the expected rate of crypto adoption. Why not be ahead of the curve and start reaping all the benefits of the decentralized economy now?\n\nCash is no longer king\nToday, we are witnessing a rapid death of cash as a go-to form of payment. Thanks to the efforts of the likes of Visa, debit and credit cards have become the preferred way for people to do shopping or conduct money transfers. Yet, despite the absolute domination of payment networks, cryptocurrencies are gradually becoming worthy contenders for them. While cards still imply the use of cash in some way or another (you may need to top up your card using the ATM), cryptocurrencies do not have a physical form in the first place. Thus, Bitcoin and its successors constitute the next step in digital finance\n\nStablecoins\nOut of all types of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins constitute the most convenient for the average consumer. Stablecoins are digital currencies which are pegged to the price of mainstream fiat currencies. For instance, one of the most popular stablecoins Tether (USDT) is pegged to the U.S. Dollar. This means that 1 Tether always equals 1 dollar. Stablecoins address the key issue slowing down the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies, namely, price fluctuations. Stablecoins do not experience any changes in their price, thus letting users utilize them as an alternative to fiat currencies while benefiting from the inherent qualities of digital assets\n\nCrypto Payment Advantages\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \t\nThe speed of transactions is among the primary features of cryptocurrencies. It does not take more than a couple of minutes for a crypto transaction to get processed. Of course, each crypto has its own speed of transactions, so you can find both those taking half an hour or five seconds to reach the recipient. For the most part, it is much faster than the speed of an average bank transfer.\nCrypto transactions are borderless. Basically, cryptocurrencies are not subject to any geographic restrictions. So, users worldwide can receive and send digital assets as long as they have access to the internet\nCryptocurrencies are anonymous. They do not ask users to share any personal information because their underlying technology of blockchain is decentralized. Thus, when you pay with crypto, you always remain private\nCryptocurrency transactions are cheap, as in most cases, one will only need to pay a small fee. Compared to banks that charge clients substantial sums of money in the form of fees, cryptocurrency transactions usually cost less than a penny",

You will have a different wallet address for each coin.\nYou can also generate your own wallet address by installing a non-custodial wallet such as Exodus.\n\nHow to Pay with Crypto\nIn order to pay someone with crypto, you only need to ask them for their crypto address and their preferred blockchain network. You will need to use this address and network to send the person a sum in crypto. If you utilize a centralized exchange such as Binance, you can conduct a payment by simply typing in the payout address, choosing the needed network, and specifying how much money you wish to send.\n\nHow to Add Crypto Payments to Legal Contracts\nYou can easily make payments in crypto official and legal, by adding information about them to your documentation. In the contract, you just need to specify the wallet address, the network, and the cryptocurrency used for payment.\n\n#blockchain #cryptocurrency #cryptopayments  #bitcoin #stablecoins #usdt",

      "description": "Why You Need to Switch to Crypto Payments?\n\nThe idea that Bitcoin has revolutionized the sphere of international finance is far from being an exaggeration. Nowadays, it is pretty clear to everyone that cryptocurrencies are here to stay, which is evidenced by the massive size of their market. If you are still reluctant to give digital assets a shot, chances are you will not have any other option than moving on to crypto payments in the next five years due to the expected rate of crypto adoption. Why not be ahead of the curve and start reaping all the benefits of the decentralized economy now?\n\nCash is no longer king\nToday, we are witnessing a rapid death of cash as a go-to form of payment. Thanks to the efforts of the likes of Visa, debit and credit cards have become the preferred way for people to do shopping or conduct money transfers. Yet, despite the absolute domination of payment networks, cryptocurrencies are gradually becoming worthy contenders for them. While cards still imply the use of cash in some way or another (you may need to top up your card using the ATM), cryptocurrencies do not have a physical form in the first place. Thus, Bitcoin and its successors constitute the next step in digital finance\n\nStablecoins\nOut of all types of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins constitute the most convenient for the average consumer. Stablecoins are digital currencies which are pegged to the price of mainstream fiat currencies. For instance, one of the most popular stablecoins Tether (USDT) is pegged to the U.S. Dollar. This means that 1 Tether always equals 1 dollar. Stablecoins address the key issue slowing down the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies, namely, price fluctuations. Stablecoins do not experience any changes in their price, thus letting users utilize them as an alternative to fiat currencies while benefiting from the inherent qualities of digital assets\n\nCrypto Payment Advantages\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \t\nThe speed of transactions is among the primary features of cryptocurrencies. It does not take more than a couple of minutes for a crypto transaction to get processed. Of course, each crypto has its own speed of transactions, so you can find both those taking half an hour or five seconds to reach the recipient. For the most part, it is much faster than the speed of an average bank transfer.\nCrypto transactions are borderless. Basically, cryptocurrencies are not subject to any geographic restrictions. So, users worldwide can receive and send digital assets as long as they have access to the internet\nCryptocurrencies are anonymous. They do not ask users to share any personal information because their underlying technology of blockchain is decentralized. Thus, when you pay with crypto, you always remain private\nCryptocurrency transactions are cheap, as in most cases, one will only need to pay a small fee. Compared to banks that charge clients substantial sums of money in the form of fees, cryptocurrency transactions usually cost less than a penny",

The service allows you to make full use of outstaffing to quickly launch IT projects by attracting self-organized teams.\nYou can hire ready-made teams with a proven track record capable of taking on any serious project on short notice.\nIn the coming weeks, we'll deploy a directory of teams.\n\n\ud83d\udfe3Teams Interface\nThanks to the newly-added Teams interface, Project Managers can build their own teams to execute full-cycle projects, as well as offer full-time or part-time employment and cooperate with numerous experts.\nThis section helps PMs put together custom teams consisting of specialists from and outside of Linki whom they can invite at any moment.\nAlternatively, you can join Linki with your existing team and expand it by recruiting the experts available on the platform, choosing those with the optimal skillset and productivity level.\n\n\u2753How PMs Can Create Teams\nA PM can create a new team\u2019s profile by adding a description, specifying its areas of expertise, and attaching a portfolio. After joining the team, the PM can plan the workload and assign team members to any project immediately.\n\n\ud83d\udfe3PMs can add team members by selecting them from their list of favorite experts or via a referral link. In order to join the team, the Expert needs to accept an offer from the PM.\n\n\ud83d\udfe3By default, Experts can join any number of teams.\nYet, PMs can mark a certain Expert as their exclusive employee. This way, the Expert will lose the ability to work with other PMs or accept any external job offers. Such a format fits established studios and agencies that have their own employees and wish to get an extra stream of orders.",

      "description": "How to Use Cryptocurrency Payments?\n\nLet\u2019s now explore how you can begin using cryptocurrencies and make full use of them.\n\nHow to Buy Crypto with Fiat\nYou can purchase your Bitcoin or other digital assets via special centralized crypto exchanges. There are a plethora of them on the market these days. Still, the most reputable ones include Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, etc.\nYou also can use P2P platforms that let you exchange your fiat money for crypto directly with other people. Still, such websites cannot protect you from scams.\n\nHow to Create a Wallet on an Exchange\nWhen you register your account on a centralized exchange, you immediately get assigned crypto wallet addresses for different types of cryptocurrencies. These addresses are similar to bank account numbers. You will have a different wallet address for each coin.\nYou can also generate your own wallet address by installing a non-custodial wallet such as Exodus.\n\nHow to Pay with Crypto\nIn order to pay someone with crypto, you only need to ask them for their crypto address and their preferred blockchain network. You will need to use this address and network to send the person a sum in crypto. If you utilize a centralized exchange such as Binance, you can conduct a payment by simply typing in the payout address, choosing the needed network, and specifying how much money you wish to send.\n\nHow to Add Crypto Payments to Legal Contracts\nYou can easily make payments in crypto official and legal, by adding information about them to your documentation. In the contract, you just need to specify the wallet address, the network, and the cryptocurrency used for payment.\n\n#blockchain #cryptocurrency #cryptopayments  #bitcoin #stablecoins #usdt",

      "description": "Why You Need to Switch to Crypto Payments?\n\nThe idea that Bitcoin has revolutionized the sphere of international finance is far from being an exaggeration. Nowadays, it is pretty clear to everyone that cryptocurrencies are here to stay, which is evidenced by the massive size of their market. If you are still reluctant to give digital assets a shot, chances are you will not have any other option than moving on to crypto payments in the next five years due to the expected rate of crypto adoption. Why not be ahead of the curve and start reaping all the benefits of the decentralized economy now?\n\nCash is no longer king\nToday, we are witnessing a rapid death of cash as a go-to form of payment. Thanks to the efforts of the likes of Visa, debit and credit cards have become the preferred way for people to do shopping or conduct money transfers. Yet, despite the absolute domination of payment networks, cryptocurrencies are gradually becoming worthy contenders for them. While cards still imply the use of cash in some way or another (you may need to top up your card using the ATM), cryptocurrencies do not have a physical form in the first place. Thus, Bitcoin and its successors constitute the next step in digital finance\n\nStablecoins\nOut of all types of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins constitute the most convenient for the average consumer. Stablecoins are digital currencies which are pegged to the price of mainstream fiat currencies. For instance, one of the most popular stablecoins Tether (USDT) is pegged to the U.S. Dollar. This means that 1 Tether always equals 1 dollar. Stablecoins address the key issue slowing down the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies, namely, price fluctuations. Stablecoins do not experience any changes in their price, thus letting users utilize them as an alternative to fiat currencies while benefiting from the inherent qualities of digital assets\n\nCrypto Payment Advantages\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \t\nThe speed of transactions is among the primary features of cryptocurrencies. It does not take more than a couple of minutes for a crypto transaction to get processed. Of course, each crypto has its own speed of transactions, so you can find both those taking half an hour or five seconds to reach the recipient. For the most part, it is much faster than the speed of an average bank transfer.\nCrypto transactions are borderless. Basically, cryptocurrencies are not subject to any geographic restrictions. So, users worldwide can receive and send digital assets as long as they have access to the internet\nCryptocurrencies are anonymous. They do not ask users to share any personal information because their underlying technology of blockchain is decentralized. Thus, when you pay with crypto, you always remain private\nCryptocurrency transactions are cheap, as in most cases, one will only need to pay a small fee. Compared to banks that charge clients substantial sums of money in the form of fees, cryptocurrency transactions usually cost less than a penny",

There are a plethora of them on the market these days. Still, the most reputable ones include Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, etc.\nYou also can use P2P platforms that let you exchange your fiat money for crypto directly with other people. Still, such websites cannot protect you from scams.\n\nHow to Create a Wallet on an Exchange\nWhen you register your account on a centralized exchange, you immediately get assigned crypto wallet addresses for different types of cryptocurrencies. These addresses are similar to bank account numbers. You will have a different wallet address for each coin.\nYou can also generate your own wallet address by installing a non-custodial wallet such as Exodus.\n\nHow to Pay with Crypto\nIn order to pay someone with crypto, you only need to ask them for their crypto address and their preferred blockchain network.

      "description": "Why You Need to Switch to Crypto Payments?\n\nThe idea that Bitcoin has revolutionized the sphere of international finance is far from being an exaggeration. Nowadays, it is pretty clear to everyone that cryptocurrencies are here to stay, which is evidenced by the massive size of their market. If you are still reluctant to give digital assets a shot, chances are you will not have any other option than moving on to crypto payments in the next five years due to the expected rate of crypto adoption. Why not be ahead of the curve and start reaping all the benefits of the decentralized economy now?\n\nCash is no longer king\nToday, we are witnessing a rapid death of cash as a go-to form of payment. Thanks to the efforts of the likes of Visa, debit and credit cards have become the preferred way for people to do shopping or conduct money transfers. Yet, despite the absolute domination of payment networks, cryptocurrencies are gradually becoming worthy contenders for them. While cards still imply the use of cash in some way or another (you may need to top up your card using the ATM), cryptocurrencies do not have a physical form in the first place. Thus, Bitcoin and its successors constitute the next step in digital finance\n\nStablecoins\nOut of all types of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins constitute the most convenient for the average consumer. Stablecoins are digital currencies which are pegged to the price of mainstream fiat currencies. For instance, one of the most popular stablecoins Tether (USDT) is pegged to the U.S. Dollar. This means that 1 Tether always equals 1 dollar. Stablecoins address the key issue slowing down the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies, namely, price fluctuations. Stablecoins do not experience any changes in their price, thus letting users utilize them as an alternative to fiat currencies while benefiting from the inherent qualities of digital assets\n\nCrypto Payment Advantages\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \t\nThe speed of transactions is among the primary features of cryptocurrencies. It does not take more than a couple of minutes for a crypto transaction to get processed. Of course, each crypto has its own speed of transactions, so you can find both those taking half an hour or five seconds to reach the recipient. For the most part, it is much faster than the speed of an average bank transfer.\nCrypto transactions are borderless. Basically, cryptocurrencies are not subject to any geographic restrictions. So, users worldwide can receive and send digital assets as long as they have access to the internet\nCryptocurrencies are anonymous. They do not ask users to share any personal information because their underlying technology of blockchain is decentralized. Thus, when you pay with crypto, you always remain private\nCryptocurrency transactions are cheap, as in most cases, one will only need to pay a small fee. Compared to banks that charge clients substantial sums of money in the form of fees, cryptocurrency transactions usually cost less than a penny",

The service allows you to make full use of outstaffing to quickly launch IT projects by attracting self-organized teams.\nYou can hire ready-made teams with a proven track record capable of taking on any serious project on short notice.\nIn the coming weeks, we'll deploy a directory of teams.\n\n\ud83d\udfe3Teams Interface\nThanks to the newly-added Teams interface, Project Managers can build their own teams to execute full-cycle projects, as well as offer full-time or part-time employment and cooperate with numerous experts.\nThis section helps PMs put together custom teams consisting of specialists from and outside of Linki whom they can invite at any moment.\nAlternatively, you can join Linki with your existing team and expand it by recruiting the experts available on the platform, choosing those with the optimal skillset and productivity level.\n\n\u2753How PMs Can Create Teams\nA PM can create a new team\u2019s profile by adding a description, specifying its areas of expertise, and attaching a portfolio. After joining the team, the PM can plan the workload and assign team members to any project immediately.\n\n\ud83d\udfe3PMs can add team members by selecting them from their list of favorite experts or via a referral link. In order to join the team, the Expert needs to accept an offer from the PM.\n\n\ud83d\udfe3By default, Experts can join any number of teams.\nYet, PMs can mark a certain Expert as their exclusive employee. This way, the Expert will lose the ability to work with other PMs or accept any external job offers. Such a format fits established studios and agencies that have their own employees and wish to get an extra stream of orders.",

The service allows you to make full use of outstaffing to quickly launch IT projects by attracting self-organized teams.\nYou can hire ready-made teams with a proven track record capable of taking on any serious project on short notice.\nIn the coming weeks, we'll deploy a directory of teams.\n\n\ud83d\udfe3Teams Interface\nThanks to the newly-added Teams interface, Project Managers can build their own teams to execute full-cycle projects, as well as offer full-time or part-time employment and cooperate with numerous experts.\nThis section helps PMs put together custom teams consisting of specialists from and outside of Linki whom they can invite at any moment.\nAlternatively, you can join Linki with your existing team and expand it by recruiting the experts available on the platform, choosing those with the optimal skillset and productivity level.\n\n\u2753How PMs Can Create Teams\nA PM can create a new team\u2019s profile by adding a description, specifying its areas of expertise, and attaching a portfolio. After joining the team, the PM can plan the workload and assign team members to any project immediately.\n\n\ud83d\udfe3PMs can add team members by selecting them from their list of favorite experts or via a referral link. In order to join the team, the Expert needs to accept an offer from the PM.\n\n\ud83d\udfe3By default, Experts can join any number of teams.\nYet, PMs can mark a certain Expert as their exclusive employee. This way, the Expert will lose the ability to work with other PMs or accept any external job offers. Such a format fits established studios and agencies that have their own employees and wish to get an extra stream of orders.",

There are a plethora of them on the market these days. Still, the most reputable ones include Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, etc.\nYou also can use P2P platforms that let you exchange your fiat money for crypto directly with other people. Still, such websites cannot protect you from scams.\n\nHow to Create a Wallet on an Exchange\nWhen you register your account on a centralized exchange, you immediately get assigned crypto wallet addresses for different types of cryptocurrencies. These addresses are similar to bank account numbers. You will have a different wallet address for each coin.\nYou can also generate your own wallet address by installing a non-custodial wallet such as Exodus.\n\nHow to Pay with Crypto\nIn order to pay someone with crypto, you only need to ask them for their crypto address and their preferred blockchain network. You will need to use this address and network to send the person a sum in crypto. If you utilize a centralized exchange such as Binance, you can conduct a payment by simply typing in the payout address, choosing the needed network, and specifying how much money you wish to send.\n\nHow to Add Crypto Payments to Legal Contracts\nYou can easily make payments in crypto official and legal, by adding information about them to your documentation. In the contract, you just need to specify the wallet address, the network, and the cryptocurrency used for payment.\n\n#blockchain #cryptocurrency #cryptopayments  #bitcoin #stablecoins #usdt",
