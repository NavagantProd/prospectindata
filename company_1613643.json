The award comes from The Knowledge Review, one of the leading magazines on education in the United States.\n\nWAY American School is a high school program that offers an American curriculum capable of preparing Brazilian students to apply to American and international universities. All this is done through the Centric platform, which houses the curriculum in the form of hundreds of educational projects available to students and teachers.\n\nSpeaking about the impacts that project-based learning has had on schools, WAY Executive Director Thiago Pinto dos Reis told Knowledge Review: \u201cWe work with thousands of students daily, and the positive impact of PBL on their lives in and out of school is evident. The feedback we receive from parents is overwhelming, who notice their child\u2019s improved communication skills, ability to express themselves creatively, and sense of independence on their learning journey, essential to their future endeavors.\u201d",

      "description": "David Chen, a teacher at Centric Learning, talks about his perceptions on how Centric Learning\u2019s PBL delivers what it promises.\n\n\"I truly do enjoy teaching here at Centric Learning. Why? Because they do practice what they preach, which is the Project-Based Learning method, or the PBL practices. This is truly important because, why? In my lifetime, I felt like I was not prepared. In most jobs, many careers and in college, most students have to work together to collaborate, to fulfill an assignment or a project.\n\nUnfortunately for me, when I grew up and when I went to high school, we still worked on memory over learning and once I got into the real world I had to learn these skills. Therefore I feel like this platform does really help students for the future. At the same time, students can work at their own pace due to their busy lifestyles.\n\nAlso, teachers can tweak their projects based on the student needs and levels, whether they\u2019re IEP students, ELLs, Honors, or GenEd.

In most jobs, many careers and in college, most students have to work together to collaborate, to fulfill an assignment or a project.\n\nUnfortunately for me, when I grew up and when I went to high school, we still worked on memory over learning and once I got into the real world I had to learn these skills. Therefore I feel like this platform does really help students for the future.

Why? Because they do practice what they preach, which is the Project-Based Learning method, or the PBL practices. This is truly important because, why? In my lifetime, I felt like I was not prepared. In most jobs, many careers and in college, most students have to work together to collaborate, to fulfill an assignment or a project.\n\nUnfortunately for me, when I grew up and when I went to high school, we still worked on memory over learning and once I got into the real world I had to learn these skills. Therefore I feel like this platform does really help students for the future. At the same time, students can work at their own pace due to their busy lifestyles.\n\nAlso, teachers can tweak their projects based on the student needs and levels, whether they\u2019re IEP students, ELLs, Honors, or GenEd. And so this is the reason why I continue and enjoy working at Centric because it is truly student-centered. at Centric Learning we really care about the students.\"\n\nCentric Learning\nhttp://centriclearning.net\n\n#centriclearning #learnatcentric",

      "reshared_post_description": "Ralph currently is the youngest student in our American High School program with Centric Learning. This is what he has to say about his experience so far with interdisciplinary, project & competency based learning:\n\n\"Hi! My name is Ralph, I\u2019m from the Netherlands and I\u2019m 12 years old. Since I started at UStudy Academy in November 2023, I\u2019ve had a lot of fun working on the various, versatile projects that the platform of Centric Learning offers. The projects contain the most diverse topics, spread across different school subjects and they often are cross-disciplinary.\n\nI greatly enjoy project-based learning. It really boosts my intrinsic motivation and gives me fantastic freedom to choose what I want to learn and work on. I can also decide for myself how extensively I go into a subject, and how much time (or desire) I have in a day to work on the projects.\n\nCentric offers themes within the projects, accompanied by videos or texts. It happened once, that the content of this theme did not match my reference frame, my perception/experience of the world, and my calendar age, because the theme was too mature. I then shared this with the teacher at Centric Learning and with my mentor. They allowed me to skip that part, because the skill I could train with this theme could also be practiced at a later time, in another project. This open, correct and adequate approach from Centric Learning was very pleasant for me and gave me new courage and inspiration to continue with the project. You can tell that I am very enthusiastic about this way of learning!\n\nContact with the teachers (and my mentor as well) is also pleasant; I find them friendly and helpful. They also give great feedback and enthusiastic compliments. The teachers and my mentor respond quickly to the questions I ask when an assignment is not clearly described on the platform. Also, my experience is that my submitted work is checked promptly. Almost always within 2 days! I have been working at the Centric Learning Platform for six months now and looking back on that period to see what was the most fun for me so far, I made a list of projects I enjoyed the most - see below in the comments:\n\n1. Video: It\u2019s Time to Coast! [Visual Arts/Physics Honors]\n2. Video: Investigating Video Games [English 09 Honors]\n3. Video: Law of Attraction [Physics Honors]\n4. Create a Mini-Movie [English 09 Honors]\n5. Powerpoint: Curate your Art [Visual Arts]\n\nI hope this wonderful style of education has made you as happy as it has made me.\ud83d\ude04\"",

Hybrid models - Districts with open positions can use online courses staffed with a qualified online educator and a paraprofessional in the classroom.\n\n2. Expertise to leverage - Virtual schools can help overcome geographical and logistical barriers by providing certified teachers in specialized or hard-to-find subjects across multiple states.\n\n3. Support systems - Online educators can act as mentors for local teachers in subjects facing the most significant staffing shortages.\n\nRemember, online teachers can be an excellent resource for addressing the teacher shortage.\n\n\ud83d\udd0e To learn more about each solution, check out the 2024 Snapshot: https://lnkd.in/gemMETKt\n\nP.S.
