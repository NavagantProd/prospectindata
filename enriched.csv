WHAT ARE VIRTUAL STICKS?
Using the on-screen joysticks from within the app, the virtual sticks send commands in real-time such as pitch, roll, yaw, and throttle to the drone just as a drone pilot would using the sticks on a larger remote-controlled drone.

Simply update your DroneBlocks apps on your Android / iOS devices to the latest version and click on the menu on the right side of the screen to reveal the new feature.

Make sure your apps are up to date today! DroneBlocks apps for Android and iOS now offer manual flight controls for Tello series drones. This new feature is called ""Virtual Sticks"". It's time to put an end to switching between apps during class!

WHAT ARE VIRTUAL STICKS?
Using the on-screen joysticks from within the app, the virtual sticks send commands in real-time such as pitch, roll, yaw, and throttle to the drone just as a drone pilot would using the sticks on a larger remote-controlled drone.

HOW DO I GET THIS FEATURE?
Simply update your DroneBlocks apps on your Android / iOS devices to the latest version and click on the menu on the right side of the screen to reveal the new feature.

Questions? Send us an email at support@droneblocks.io, we will be happy to help.

The award comes from The Knowledge Review, one of the leading magazines on education in the United States.

WAY American School is a high school program that offers an American curriculum capable of preparing Brazilian students to apply to American and international universities. All this is done through the Centric platform, which houses the curriculum in the form of hundreds of educational projects available to students and teachers.

Speaking about the impacts that project-based learning has had on schools, WAY Executive Director Thiago Pinto dos Reis told Knowledge Review: “We work with thousands of students daily, and the positive impact of PBL on their lives in and out of school is evident. The feedback we receive from parents is overwhelming, who notice their child’s improved communication skills, ability to express themselves creatively, and sense of independence on their learning journey, essential to their future endeavors.”",1,1,6mo,"Amy Cook, teacher at Centric Learning and WAY American School, talks a little about what she likes most about the active methodology of PBL (Project-Based Learning).

#centriclearning #learnatcentric",3,3,7mo,"David Chen, a teacher at Centric Learning, talks about his perceptions on how Centric Learning’s PBL delivers what it promises.

""I truly do enjoy teaching here at Centric Learning. Why? Because they do practice what they preach, which is the Project-Based Learning method, or the PBL practices. This is truly important because, why? In my lifetime, I felt like I was not prepared. In most jobs, many careers and in college, most students have to work together to collaborate, to fulfill an assignment or a project.

Unfortunately for me, when I grew up and when I went to high school, we still worked on memory over learning and once I got into the real world I had to learn these skills. Therefore I feel like this platform does really help students for the future. At the same time, students can work at their own pace due to their busy lifestyles.

Also, teachers can tweak their projects based on the student needs and levels, whether they’re IEP students, ELLs, Honors, or GenEd. And so this is the reason why I continue and enjoy working at Centric because it is truly student-centered. at Centric Learning we really care about the students.""

The award comes from The Knowledge Review, one of the leading magazines on education in the United States.

WAY American School is a high school program that offers an American curriculum capable of preparing Brazilian students to apply to American and international universities. All this is done through the Centric platform, which houses the curriculum in the form of hundreds of educational projects available to students and teachers.

Speaking about the impacts that project-based learning has had on schools, WAY Executive Director Thiago Pinto dos Reis told Knowledge Review: “We work with thousands of students daily, and the positive impact of PBL on their lives in and out of school is evident. The feedback we receive from parents is overwhelming, who notice their child’s improved communication skills, ability to express themselves creatively, and sense of independence on their learning journey, essential to their future endeavors.”",1,1,6mo,"Amy Cook, teacher at Centric Learning and WAY American School, talks a little about what she likes most about the active methodology of PBL (Project-Based Learning).

#centriclearning #learnatcentric",3,3,7mo,"David Chen, a teacher at Centric Learning, talks about his perceptions on how Centric Learning’s PBL delivers what it promises.

""I truly do enjoy teaching here at Centric Learning. Why? Because they do practice what they preach, which is the Project-Based Learning method, or the PBL practices. This is truly important because, why? In my lifetime, I felt like I was not prepared. In most jobs, many careers and in college, most students have to work together to collaborate, to fulfill an assignment or a project.

Unfortunately for me, when I grew up and when I went to high school, we still worked on memory over learning and once I got into the real world I had to learn these skills. Therefore I feel like this platform does really help students for the future. At the same time, students can work at their own pace due to their busy lifestyles.

Also, teachers can tweak their projects based on the student needs and levels, whether they’re IEP students, ELLs, Honors, or GenEd. And so this is the reason why I continue and enjoy working at Centric because it is truly student-centered. at Centric Learning we really care about the students.""
