Optical Flow allows for incredibly accurate positioning while flying in GPS denied environments. Optical flow sensors measure the motion of surfaces below the drone by detecting the movement of patterns in imagery captured in real-time. In the future, expect more Drone manufacturers to mimic this capability...you can get your students there first by bringing a DEXI to their classroom!\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/g_UEKDMJ",
