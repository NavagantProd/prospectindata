Well, kinda.\n\nOn June 1st, the European Space Agency and SETI teamed up to conduct an experiment to see just how prepared we Earthlings are if we were to ever receive an alien message from outer space one day \u2013 a sort of \u201cfire drill\u201d to prepare for the real thing. This mock alien signal was sent from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, a spacecraft sent to Mars in 2016 by the ESA to orbit and study the Martian atmosphere. After traveling through space for 16 minutes, the signal was detected here on Earth by the Allen Telescope Array in Northern California, the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, and the Medicina Radio Astronomical Station near Bologna, Italy. In an effort to raise public interest and involvement, the data was released publicly on the internet to see who could decipher its contents first. Groups of internet sleuths are still hard at work separating the signal from background noise and decoding the meaning of the message.\n\nThis project, called \u201cA Sign in Space,\u201d not only serves as a great way to test our ability to intercept and interpret a message from an alien civilization in the future, but it also proves that such an endeavor would truly be a global, collaborative effort if the real thing were to ever occur. Let\u2019s cross our fingers. Or tentacles. Whatever.\"\n\n- Dr. Jake Roark, STEM Education Works Curriculum and Outreach Specialist\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gfptRHdw",
