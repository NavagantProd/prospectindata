  "description": "The single factor that has the highest impact on the prosperity and well-being of humankind is education. Still, technology has not yet delivered on any of its promises for better learning. At Kognity, we have set out to change this. Our vision is to radically improve learning for the world\u2019s school students.\n\nKognity is the all-in-one, curriculum-aligned teaching and learning platform for Cambridge IGCSE\u2122, the IB Diploma Programme and High School Science. The platform provides interactive textbooks, analytics and assessment support \u2013 all in one place. We are experts at combining pedagogy and technology to create comprehensive, engaging, digital-first teaching and learning resources. Kognity saves teachers time, improves learning experiences and empowers students to become independent learners.\n\nIt all began with two students who wanted to create the dynamic and interactive learning resources they\u2019d always wanted to experience in their own classrooms. Today, teachers and students in over 1000 schools and over 100 countries rely on Kognity.",

Last week, we had the honor to chat with Deborah M\u00fchlrad about the art of listening to your body's signals. \n\nDeborah shared practical tips and strategies that we can apply in our daily lives to work proactively and prioritize our well-being.\n\nHere are our key takeaways from the session:\n\n1. Physical health: What time you go to bed matters! Research shows that our bodies recover physically between 10 pm - 2 am.\n2. Mental Health: Turn off notifications or use flight mode when you need to focus. This will reduce noise and help you stay on task.\n3. Emotional health: Plan on how to communicate how you feel. Put words to your feelings and share with others when you need support.\n\nThank you for an engaging and informative session, Deborah M\u00fchlrad.",

I found I only use 20% of Kognity's potential, but even with that 20% it has already made a significant impact on my students\u2019 results!\u201d \n\nWe recently had the absolute pleasure of hosting \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\udde9 Engage Indonesia \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\udde9  at The Singapore School Pantai Indah Kapuk in Jakarta.\u00a0What a treat it was to brush shoulders with passionate and likeminded educators. The entire day was buzzing with excitement and was as impactful as it was humid.\n\nWhat did we learn?\n\ud83d\udc99 We have users who are passionate about Kognity and know how to show it. I can only assume this is directly connected to the relationships\u00a0\nKim Sofie M\u00f8ller Warmedal and\u00a0Richard Morgan have built with schools in the region. \n\n\ud83e\udd16 Per Wising\u2019s session on AI in particular made space for these educators to initiate a powerful conversations on how AI should be utilized in the classroom and we were all better for it. \n\n\ud83d\ude4b\u2642\ufe0f During my enablement session, I was able to display quick and digestible strategies for how to increase student engagement with Kognity. Big shout out to\u00a0Theo Trotzig\u00a0for helping to answer questions during this session. His technical answers really helped the session come alive. \n\n\n\ud83e\udd1dAnother big thank you to Daniel Bayram Vasquez V.\u00a0for speaking to nearly every attendee over the day and initiating valuable conversations we would have not been able to have otherwise.\n\n\ud83e\udd73 None of this would have been possible without the dedication and hard work from Katilina Gaffney It was amazing to see how Kati maximized the days potential with truly brilliant sessions, including giving time during the start of the event for a leaders lunch. We used this time to discuss a growth mindset in education and how to take actionable steps toward implementing this mindset. \n\n\ud83d\udc83 \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f As the day came to a close, we all enjoyed drinks, dinner and a few karaoke tunes from our very own\u00a0Charlotte (Lottie) Trimmer Trimmer.\n\nAll in all, it was an extremely successful Engage event and memorable experience for everyone who attended. \n\n\ud83d\ude4f P.S. thank you to everyone else who made this event possible including our amazing Kognity community who attended. It\u2019s our vision to impact the world\u2019s students and we could not have done this without you. Thank you!",

Google it. There might be an open source version out there! \ud83d\ude09  \n\n\u2b50 Got inspired by Saaya Sorrells-Weatherford\u2019s talk on advocating for women and immigrants in tech.\n\n\u2b50 Tobias Modig's message about avoiding burnout and building solid learning foundations hit home. Sometimes, slowing down makes us better programmers in the long run.\n\n\u2b50 \ud83c\udf0c Dr. Cristi\u00e1n Maureira-Fredes\u2019s dive into CPython and the low-level possibilities it unlocks. Ever thought of creating your own Python using a different alphabet? It's possible\u2014and he showed us how with Swedish! \n\nNetworking: \n\u2b50 Shared ideas with Javier de la Puente Alonso on deploying Flask apps using JuJu on Google Cloud. \n\u2b50 Connected with incredible minds like Anastasiia Potekhina and Beatriz Uezu from PyLadies Stockholm, and Saad Hasan - the AI and database wiz. \n\nWorkshops I loved:\n\u2b50 Schneider Electric (Kamil Kulig & Adam Brzyzek): Hands-on setting up a MongoDB (NoSQL) database and CRUD operations.\n\u2b50 Lyst: Using Gen AI to tag themes in customer reviews. Practical, innovative, and game-changing!\n\u2b50 46elks: Chat with AI over SMS. Set up a live chatbot in real-time\u2014great for experimenting with AI-driven SMS solutions.\n\nWhy Attend Events Like PyCon\u2753 \nMeeting people, sharing ideas, and seeing what others are building is incredibly motivating. If you\u2019ve ever thought about attending a conference like this\u2014do it. You\u2019ll leave with new skills, a stronger network, and a deeper love for the field. \n\nIt was my first. Can\u2019t wait for the next one.",

I found I only use 20% of Kognity's potential, but even with that 20% it has already made a significant impact on my students\u2019 results!\u201d \n\nWe recently had the absolute pleasure of hosting \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\udde9 Engage Indonesia \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\udde9  at The Singapore School Pantai Indah Kapuk in Jakarta.\u00a0What a treat it was to brush shoulders with passionate and likeminded educators. The entire day was buzzing with excitement and was as impactful as it was humid.\n\nWhat did we learn?\n\ud83d\udc99 We have users who are passionate about Kognity and know how to show it. I can only assume this is directly connected to the relationships\u00a0\nKim Sofie M\u00f8ller Warmedal and\u00a0Richard Morgan have built with schools in the region. \n\n\ud83e\udd16 Per Wising\u2019s session on AI in particular made space for these educators to initiate a powerful conversations on how AI should be utilized in the classroom and we were all better for it. \n\n\ud83d\ude4b\u2642\ufe0f During my enablement session, I was able to display quick and digestible strategies for how to increase student engagement with Kognity. Big shout out to\u00a0Theo Trotzig\u00a0for helping to answer questions during this session. His technical answers really helped the session come alive. \n\n\n\ud83e\udd1dAnother big thank you to Daniel Bayram Vasquez V.\u00a0for speaking to nearly every attendee over the day and initiating valuable conversations we would have not been able to have otherwise.\n\n\ud83e\udd73 None of this would have been possible without the dedication and hard work from Katilina Gaffney It was amazing to see how Kati maximized the days potential with truly brilliant sessions, including giving time during the start of the event for a leaders lunch. We used this time to discuss a growth mindset in education and how to take actionable steps toward implementing this mindset. \n\n\ud83d\udc83 \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f As the day came to a close, we all enjoyed drinks, dinner and a few karaoke tunes from our very own\u00a0Charlotte (Lottie) Trimmer Trimmer.\n\nAll in all, it was an extremely successful Engage event and memorable experience for everyone who attended. \n\n\ud83d\ude4f P.S. thank you to everyone else who made this event possible including our amazing Kognity community who attended. It\u2019s our vision to impact the world\u2019s students and we could not have done this without you. Thank you!",

Google it. There might be an open source version out there! \ud83d\ude09  \n\n\u2b50 Got inspired by Saaya Sorrells-Weatherford\u2019s talk on advocating for women and immigrants in tech.\n\n\u2b50 Tobias Modig's message about avoiding burnout and building solid learning foundations hit home. Sometimes, slowing down makes us better programmers in the long run.\n\n\u2b50 \ud83c\udf0c Dr. Cristi\u00e1n Maureira-Fredes\u2019s dive into CPython and the low-level possibilities it unlocks. Ever thought of creating your own Python using a different alphabet? It's possible\u2014and he showed us how with Swedish! \n\nNetworking: \n\u2b50 Shared ideas with Javier de la Puente Alonso on deploying Flask apps using JuJu on Google Cloud. \n\u2b50 Connected with incredible minds like Anastasiia Potekhina and Beatriz Uezu from PyLadies Stockholm, and Saad Hasan - the AI and database wiz. \n\nWorkshops I loved:\n\u2b50 Schneider Electric (Kamil Kulig & Adam Brzyzek): Hands-on setting up a MongoDB (NoSQL) database and CRUD operations.\n\u2b50 Lyst: Using Gen AI to tag themes in customer reviews. Practical, innovative, and game-changing!\n\u2b50 46elks: Chat with AI over SMS. Set up a live chatbot in real-time\u2014great for experimenting with AI-driven SMS solutions.\n\nWhy Attend Events Like PyCon\u2753 \nMeeting people, sharing ideas, and seeing what others are building is incredibly motivating. If you\u2019ve ever thought about attending a conference like this\u2014do it. You\u2019ll leave with new skills, a stronger network, and a deeper love for the field. \n\nIt was my first. Can\u2019t wait for the next one.",

Instead, it\u2019s about enhancing it. \ud83d\udca1\n\nAt Kognity, we believe in empowering educators with tools that support blended learning, where digital resources complement in-person instruction. Whether it\u2019s extending learning beyond the classroom, providing instant feedback, or offering data-driven insights, a digital curriculum is designed to work with you, not against you.\n\nOur latest blog breaks down how:\n\ud83d\udd2c NGSS-aligned digital curricula enrich hands-on, inquiry-based learning.\n\ud83c\udfaf Flexible tools can adapt to traditional, flipped, or hybrid classrooms.\n\ud83d\udcca Analytics help you track progress and personalize support for every student.\n\nReady to see how digital tools can empower your teaching, not replace it?
