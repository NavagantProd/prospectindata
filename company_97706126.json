Despite the varying options available to families, such as private schools, homeschooling, and charter schools, traditional public schools continue to serve the majority (83 percent) of all America\u2019s students.1\u00a0Therefore, the United States must continue to transform the public K-12 system to meet the demands of a changing world.\nThis can and should be done by improving teacher compensation, development, and retention, as well as by modernizing the school facilities in which they teach. Transforming the K-12 system also will require policymakers to address artificial intelligence\u2019s (AI) place in the classroom and expand wraparound support services for students\u2019 health and well-being in their schools and their communities. To prepare secondary students to enter and thrive in the digital age, the K-12 system also needs to expand high-quality college and career pathways. All these reforms will require increased investments for public education. To build upon the benefits and value of the public education system while addressing its challenges, the United States must continue to invest in students, families, and educators.\nhashtag\n\n#AI hashtag\n#ArtificialIntellegence hashtag\n#Edtech hashtag\n#AIineducation",
