A great task launch sparks curiosity, invites student thinking, and sets the stage for deep mathematical exploration. But how we launch matters!\n\nJoin us for this month\u2019s Struggly Presents Webinar, \"It's all in the Launch: Strategies for Launching Rich Math Tasks,\" where we\u2019ll explore powerful strategies to get tasks started in ways that empower students as sense-makers.\nWe\u2019re thrilled to be joined by Michele Benedetti, Struggly Ambassador and coach for the Campbell Union School District.

A great task launch sparks curiosity, invites student thinking, and sets the stage for deep mathematical exploration. But how we launch matters!\n\nJoin us for this month\u2019s Struggly Presents Webinar, \"It's all in the Launch: Strategies for Launching Rich Math Tasks,\" where we\u2019ll explore powerful strategies to get tasks started in ways that empower students as sense-makers.\nWe\u2019re thrilled to be joined by Michele Benedetti, Struggly Ambassador and coach for the Campbell Union School District. Together we will explore three essential task launch styles:\n\ud83d\udd39 Notice & Wonder\n\ud83d\udd39 Student Exploration\n\ud83d\udd39 Learning Keys\n\nEven better\u2014we\u2019ll watch classroom video of Michele launching a task with 5th graders in real time! Plus, you\u2019ll get to experience a few tasks yourself\u2014because the best way to learn is to play. Don\u2019t miss this free professional learning opportunity! \n\nRegister now: [ https://lnkd.in/gGj7Xiab ]\n\n#MathEducation #TaskLaunch #FreePD #GrowthMindset #Struggly #ProductiveStruggle #K8math #ITeachMath #JoBoaler #mathcoach",
